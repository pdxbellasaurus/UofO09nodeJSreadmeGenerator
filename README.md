## Overview
It is important to have a high-quality README for your open source projects created on GitHub. The README should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. 

This application is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
 
## Application Specifications
This application runs using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on [Chrome's V8 engine](https://v8.dev/) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Additionally, this application uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), a promise-based npm package used in Node projects to create CLI (Command Line Interface) tools for query-based tasks. 

## Application Functionality

The application is invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

The following is a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application:
